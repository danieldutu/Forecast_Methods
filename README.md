# Forecast_Methods
## Different forecast approaches side by side comparison on a dataset.

The purpose of this notebook is to find the optimal approach for forecasting a timeseries.


# Model Building
First, I transformed the column variable into variables. I also split the data into train and tests sets with a test size of 20%.

I tried three different models and evaluated them using Mean Absolute Error. I chose MAE because it is relatively easy to interpret and outliers arenâ€™t particularly bad in for this type of model.

# I tried three different models:

**ARIMA** <br>
**Long Short Term Memory**  <br>
**Prophet** <br>

ARIMA model far outperformed the other approaches on the test sets, but the models weren't tuned at their maximum performance.

	Models	RMSE Errors	MSE Errors
0	ARIMA	0.765449	0.585912
1	LSTM	1.328145	1.763970
2	Prophet	1.591280	2.532170
